**HOME BASED SECURITY SYSTEM**



1. IoT Gateway:
Device: Raspberry Pi or similar Arduino pro mini-computer.
Justification: Raspberry Pi or Arduino pro mini is a versatile and cost-effective choice. It can run the necessary software for data processing and communication, making it an ideal gateway for connecting various sensors and devices.
2. Surveillance Cameras:
Device: IP cameras or smart security cameras.
Justification: IP cameras can capture high-quality video and support remote access. Many come with built-in motion sensors, night vision, and two-way audio, enhancing security and monitoring capabilities.
3. Motion Sensors:
Device: Passive Infrared (PIR) motion sensors.
Justification: PIR sensors are cost-effective and efficient for detecting motion in an area. They are reliable for security applications and can trigger alerts when movement is detected.
4. Door/Window Sensors:
Device: Magnetic door/window sensors.
Justification: These sensors are simple, reliable, and cost-effective. They are commonly used for detecting unauthorized entry or opening of doors and windows.
5. Smart Locks:
Device: Smart door locks with Z-Wave or Wi-Fi connectivity.
Justification: Smart locks can be remotely controlled and monitored through a mobile app. Z-Wave or Wi-Fi connectivity ensures seamless integration with the IoT system.
6. Environmental Sensors:
Device: Smoke detectors, temperature sensors, and carbon monoxide detectors.
Justification: Smoke detectors provide early warning of fires, temperature sensors monitor for extreme temperature changes, and carbon monoxide detectors detect potentially lethal gases. These sensors enhance safety and well-being.
7. Communication Module:
Choice: Wi-Fi and/or Zigbee/Z-Wave.
Justification:
Wi-Fi: Suitable for high-speed data transfer and remote access to surveillance cameras and smart locks. Zigbee/Z-Wave: Ideal for low-power, short-range communication between sensors and the gateway. These protocols are energy-efficient and provide a reliable mesh network for sensor data transmission.
8. Mobile App:
Device: Smartphone or tablet.
Justification: The mobile app serves as the user interface for remote monitoring and control, allowing homeowners to receive alerts and access live camera feeds.
9. Cloud Storage:
Device: Cloud servers for storing video footage and sensor data.
Justification: Cloud storage ensures data is secure, accessible from anywhere, and can serve as a backup in case local storage is compromised.
10. Siren/Alarm:
Device: Smart sirens or alarms.
Justification: In the event of a security breach or emergency, a loud siren or alarm can deter intruders and alert nearby residents. Smart sirens can be remotely triggered.
11. Sprinkler 
Device: Sprinkler 
Justification: In the event of a security breach, the sprinklers would come on so as to make the trespasser think that there is someone in the house. The sprinkler is also controllable in events when the users would like to water his/her garden remotely especially when the soil moisture sensor levels are low.
